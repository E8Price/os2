char log[1024];

void* log_message(void* arg) {
    snprintf(log, sizeof(log), "Thread %d wrote this\n", *(int*)arg);
    return NULL;
}

Race Explanation:
Two threads run snprintf() at the same time
They both write to the same log buffer
The result is a mix of both messages, or one overwrites the other


int lock = 0;

void acquire() {
    while (lock) {}  // spin
    lock = 1;
}

void release() {
    lock = 0;
}

Race Explanation:
Thread A checks lock and sees 0
Before A sets lock = 1, Thread B also checks and sees 0
Now both A and B think they got the lock and set lock = 1
Now both are inside the critical section at the same time

int counter = 0;

void* inc(void* _) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i)
        counter = counter + 1;
    return NULL;
}

Race Explanation:
Thread A reads counter, adds 1, about to store it
Thread B reads the same old value of counter, adds 1
Both write back the same result, losing one count

int counter = 0;

void* inc(void* _) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i)
        counter++;
    return NULL;
}

Race Explanation:
Thread A reads counter, adds 1, about to store it
Thread B reads the same old value of counter, adds 1
Both write back the same result, losing one count
